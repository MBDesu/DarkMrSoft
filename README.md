# DarkMrSoft

DarkMrSoft is a web app utility for patching CPS2 ROMs with the patches found in a MiSTer `.mra` file. The immediate goal of this project is to service Darksoft/MAME users who would like to use these ROMhacks on those platforms, with a longer term goal of eventually being an in-browser toolchain for CPS2 ROMhacking in general.
